# Variables

Camunda: https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/variables/

Kogito: https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/1.15.0/html_single/#con-bpmn-variables_kogito-developing-process-services

Basically the same structure of local and process variables.  Kogito has Variable Labels which is very useful!
